# go-perspectiveapi 
go-perspectiveapi is a Go client library for [Google Jigsaw's Perspective
API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/)

Currently, the AnalyzeComment endpoint is supported with default parameters.
I plan to add features as necessary for my purposes - but of course, pull
requests are welcome.

See `main.go` for how to use the library in its current form.
